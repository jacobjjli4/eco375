===Things to edit===
Abstract
- expand on our motivation: "There is evidence of substantial socio-economic differences between neighbourhoods with differential access to credit... we investigate political outcomes..."

Introduction
- outline findings and thesis in the introduction
- reiterate that there is little research on political outcomes and why we care about political outcomes
	- inform political strategy, interested in how "old" policy may or may not have long-term effects

Context and Data
- more explicitly talk about unit of observation, independent, dependent variable, population of interest
- explain variation in our X (i.e., how data was generated); observational data, variation is generated by policy
- merge some paragraphs together
- talk about how the covariates vary (observational data)

Regression Analysis
- talk about measures of fit and how they change
- include equations on some models
- talk about t-test and f-tests a little bit
	- talk about our null and alternate hypotheses
- talk about marginal effects in model (5) in terms of partial derivatives
- add discussion of functional form (like log and why we can't do it)

Conclusion
- mention why we care about political outcomes, its relevancy to political strategy
- link to literature (we find no effects; literature finds long-lasting effects)
	- talk about differences in methodology and the limitations on our methodology

===Things to add===
Context and Data
- summary statistics and how they compare to summary statistics of census tracts not in our sample
	- add this to the limitations section and talk about external validity
- reference scatterplots for grade C and grade D share and mention clustering at either end of the distribution
- reference Brooklyn redlining map to use as an example of a HOLC map
