Abstract (Jacob)

Intro (Ben)

Context & Data (Ben)
- what is redlining?
- what are the effects of redlining?
- how we merged our data
- geographical distribution census tracts that we use (map)
- discuss summary statistics

Simple Linear Regression (Jacob)
- discuss results
- discuss if LSAs hold
- limitations of the simple model (OVB)

Multiple Linear Regression (Jacob)
- explain why we chose the covariates that we did (Ben)
- introduce models, explain why we chose the models that we did
- discuss results

Limitations (Ben)
- internal validity
	- OVB (other geographically targeted government programs)
	- wrong functional form (log?)
	- errors-in-variables (census tract is pretty small, so there may be measurement error)
	- sample selection (Kentucky and West Virginia did not have voting data)
	- simultaneous causality (no, there is temporal separation)
- external validity
	- our study was on cities with >40000 population in 1930 (double check)
	- leaves out many Western cities

Conclusion (Jacob)
