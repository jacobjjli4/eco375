What cutoff should we use for observations that are not entirely within the HOLC mapped area?
- Run multiple regressions
- consider using base specification with only the tracts that are 95% or 90% in the HOLC mapped area
- for robustness, adjust regression by 5% each time to see if the results remain similar

How can we include C or D tracts in our independent variable?
- Multiple options:
	- regress on only D (baseline model)
	- take the sum of C and D
	- regress on C and D individually
	- consider regressing on B, C, and D
